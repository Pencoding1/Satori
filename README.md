The artworks and music aren't mine.
I develop this app just for self-learning.

# How it works

It's just a simple algorithm. I stole it from a math book for kids.
Just take 1000 consecutively divide by 2 and then add the number asked in the previous question.
If meet the odd number, for the first time, subtract 0.5 to round off. Next time meet the odd number, add 0.5 to round.
